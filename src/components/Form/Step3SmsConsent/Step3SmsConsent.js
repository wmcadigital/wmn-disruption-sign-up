          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            This trial is being run by West Midlands Network (WMN) to explore whether our customers
            would like to receive information about disruptions on the network through text message
            alerts.
          </p>
          <h4>Text message alerts</h4>
          <p>
            Text messages will be sent from ‘WM Network’ and are sent automatically when a
            disruption is entered into our systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The text messages we send to you are free. We can’t read any replies you send to the
            text message alerts, however you may still be charged by your mobile network for doing
            so.
          </p>
          <div>
            <WarningText type="warning" message={message} className="wmnds-m-b-md" />
          </div>

          <p>
            We’ll occasionally send a text asking for feedback about the service. The message will
            include a link that will take you to a survey. We will use responses to improve the
            service.
          </p>
          <h4>End of the trial</h4>
          <p>
            At the end of the trial, we’ll text you to let you know you won’t receive any more text
            message alerts from us.
          </p>
          <p>We’ll also email you to let you know how the trial went.</p>
          <h4>Trial participation information</h4>
          <p>

            <li>Phone number</li>
          </ul>

          </p>
          <p>
            If you remain signed up to email alerts after the trial ends, the service keeps your
            details until you decide to unsubscribe from all alerts. You can do this through the
            ‘manage my preferences’ link at the bottom of email alerts.
